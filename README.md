The idea of this assignment for the Coursera Course "HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Web Developers" is to take an existing array of names
and then output either Hello 'Name' or Good Bye 'Name' to the console.
The program should say "Hello" to any name except names that start with a "J" or "j", otherwise, the program should say "Good Bye". 

In order for this to happen, we had to rewrite the functions in both the SpeakHello.js and SpeakGoodBye.js. We had to create objects of 
both classes and then attach them to the corresponding functions.
